 * Defines polymorphic relationship types for job ownership tracking.

 * Specifies the identifier format used in polymorphic relationships that track
 * which model owns or is associated with a supervised job. The chosen type must
 * match the primary key type of the models being referenced. Maps to Laravel's
 * Blueprint morph method variants.
 *
 * ```php
 * // Configuration example
 * 'morph_type' => MorphType::UUID,  // For User model with UUID primary keys
 *
 * // Migration usage (handled automatically)
 * $table->uuidMorphs('owner');  // Creates owner_type and owner_id columns
 * ```
